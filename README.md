# PythonQRplayground V1.0.1
Simplistic QR code generator made in python using the *qrcode* module.

## Dependencies
Running the source code requires two modules:
- Image
- qrcode

## You can install them using:
*pip install Image*

*pip install qrcode*

**If you are running the [compiled EXE file](https://github.com/MightySpaceman/PythonQRplayground/releases/tag/V1.0), however, you will only need the windows operating system, and installing python or the script's modules is not necessary.**
