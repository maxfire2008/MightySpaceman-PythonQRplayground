# PythonQRplayground V1.0
Simplistic QR code generator made in python using the *qrcode* python module.

## Dependencies
Running the source code requires two modules:
- Image
- qrcode

### You can install them using:
*pip install Image*
*pip install qrcode*

If you are running the compiled EXE file, however, you will only need the windows operating system, and installing python or the script's modules is not necessary.
